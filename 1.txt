Q1.what is Shell scripting?
Q/shell scripitng vs Python scripting
Q2.why pyhton for devops
Q3.why linux used in devops
Q4.What is the purpose of shell scripting? What is the Role of "filename./test.sh" command?
ans4.Instead of running different commands and reading the outputs one after the other,we can put all those shell commands in filename./test.sh. Doing so will print the output on the terminal. Thus prime purpose of shell scripting is to interact with the linux systems.To manage these linux systems we use shell commands. 
Q5.If we can interact with linux via shell scripting then why do we need python?
ans5.2 fundamental reason: 1)As a devops engineer most of the things we interact with is linux systems, however there can be instances where we might need to interact with windows as well.Shell scripting is only restricted to linux,but python can be used to interact with both windows and linux. 2)[VIP]. When we need to write complex programs(API callng,Data manipulation etc), then in such cases python wins over shell scripting by doings the tasks in much simpler way.


Q6.If Ansible(YAML scripting) works for both Linux and Windows then why do we need python?
ans6.First of all the foundation of ansible is laid on pyhton.Ansible is written in python.Hence this is the reason we can use ansible to run things on both linux and windows.
